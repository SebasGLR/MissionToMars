<h2>I</h2>
<p>
In my younger and more vulnerable years my father gave me some advice that I’ve been turning over in my mind ever since.
</p>
<p>
“Whenever you feel like criticizing anyone,” he told me, “just remember that all the people in this world haven’t had the advantages that you’ve had.”
</p>
<p>
He didn’t say any more, but we’ve always been unusually communicative in a reserved way, and I understood that he meant a great deal more than that. In consequence, I’m inclined to reserve all judgements, a habit that has opened up many curious natures to me and also made me the victim of not a few veteran bores. The abnormal mind is quick to detect and attach itself to this quality when it appears in a normal person, and so it came about that in college I was unjustly accused of being a politician, because I was privy to the secret griefs of wild, unknown men. Most of the confidences were unsought—frequently I have feigned sleep, preoccupation, or a hostile levity when I realized by some unmistakable sign that an intimate revelation was quivering on the horizon; for the intimate revelations of young men, or at least the terms in which they express them, are usually plagiaristic and marred by obvious suppressions. Reserving judgements is a matter of infinite hope. I am still a little afraid of missing something if I forget that, as my father snobbishly suggested, and I snobbishly repeat, a sense of the fundamental decencies is parcelled out unequally at birth.
</p>
<p>
And, after boasting this way of my tolerance, I come to the admission that it has a limit. Conduct may be founded on the hard rock or the wet marshes, but after a certain point I don’t care what it’s founded on. When I came back from the East last autumn I felt that I wanted the world to be in uniform and at a sort of moral attention forever; I wanted no more riotous excursions with privileged glimpses into the human heart. Only Gatsby, the man who gives his name to this book, was exempt from my reaction—Gatsby, who represented everything for which I have an unaffected scorn. If personality is an unbroken series of successful gestures, then there was something gorgeous about him, some heightened sensitivity to the promises of life, as if he were related to one of those intricate machines that register earthquakes ten thousand miles away. This responsiveness had nothing to do with that flabby impressionability which is dignified under the name of the “creative temperament”—it was an extraordinary gift for hope, a romantic readiness such as I have never found in any other person and which it is not likely I shall ever find again. No—Gatsby turned out all right at the end; it is what preyed on Gatsby, what foul dust floated in the wake of his dreams that temporarily closed out my interest in the abortive sorrows and short-winded elations of men.
</p>
<hr>
<p>
My family have been prominent, well-to-do people in this Middle Western city for three generations. The Carraways are something of a clan, and we have a tradition that we’re descended from the Dukes of Buccleuch, but the actual founder of my line was my grandfather’s brother, who came here in fifty-one, sent a substitute to the Civil War, and started the wholesale hardware business that my father carries on today.
</p>
<p>
I never saw this great-uncle, but I’m supposed to look like him—with special reference to the rather hard-boiled painting that hangs in father’s office. I graduated from New Haven in 1915, just a quarter of a century after my father, and a little later I participated in that delayed Teutonic migration known as the Great War. I enjoyed the counter-raid so thoroughly that I came back restless. Instead of being the warm centre of the world, the Middle West now seemed like the ragged edge of the universe—so I decided to go East and learn the bond business. Everybody I knew was in the bond business, so I supposed it could support one more single man. All my aunts and uncles talked it over as if they were choosing a prep school for me, and finally said, “Why—ye-es,” with very grave, hesitant faces. Father agreed to finance me for a year, and after various delays I came East, permanently, I thought, in the spring of twenty-two.
</p>
<p>
The practical thing was to find rooms in the city, but it was a warm season, and I had just left a country of wide lawns and friendly trees, so when a young man at the office suggested that we take a house together in a commuting town, it sounded like a great idea. He found the house, a weather-beaten cardboard bungalow at eighty a month, but at the last minute the firm ordered him to Washington, and I went out to the country alone. I had a dog—at least I had him for a few days until he ran away—and an old Dodge and a Finnish woman, who made my bed and cooked breakfast and muttered Finnish wisdom to herself over the electric stove.
</p>
<p>
It was lonely for a day or so until one morning some man, more recently arrived than I, stopped me on the road.
</p>
<p>
“How do you get to West Egg village?” he asked helplessly.
</p>
<p>
I told him. And as I walked on I was lonely no longer. I was a guide, a pathfinder, an original settler. He had casually conferred on me the freedom of the neighbourhood.
</p>
<p>
And so with the sunshine and the great bursts of leaves growing on the trees, just as things grow in fast movies, I had that familiar conviction that life was beginning over again with the summer.
</p>
<p>
There was so much to read, for one thing, and so much fine health to be pulled down out of the young breath-giving air. I bought a dozen volumes on banking and credit and investment securities, and they stood on my shelf in red and gold like new money from the mint, promising to unfold the shining secrets that only Midas and Morgan and Maecenas knew. And I had the high intention of reading many other books besides. I was rather literary in college—one year I wrote a series of very solemn and obvious editorials for the Yale News—and now I was going to bring back all such things into my life and become again that most limited of all specialists, the “well-rounded man.” This isn’t just an epigram—life is much more successfully looked at from a single window, after all.
</p>
<p>
It was a matter of chance that I should have rented a house in one of the strangest communities in North America. It was on that slender riotous island which extends itself due east of New York—and where there are, among other natural curiosities, two unusual formations of land. Twenty miles from the city a pair of enormous eggs, identical in contour and separated only by a courtesy bay, jut out into the most domesticated body of salt water in the Western hemisphere, the great wet barnyard of Long Island Sound. They are not perfect ovals—like the egg in the Columbus story, they are both crushed flat at the contact end—but their physical resemblance must be a source of perpetual wonder to the gulls that fly overhead. To the wingless a more interesting phenomenon is their dissimilarity in every particular except shape and size.
</p>
<p>
I lived at West Egg, the—well, the less fashionable of the two, though this is a most superficial tag to express the bizarre and not a little sinister contrast between them. My house was at the very tip of the egg, only fifty yards from the Sound, and squeezed between two huge places that rented for twelve or fifteen thousand a season. The one on my right was a colossal affair by any standard—it was a factual imitation of some Hôtel de Ville in Normandy, with a tower on one side, spanking new under a thin beard of raw ivy, and a marble swimming pool, and more than forty acres of lawn and garden. It was Gatsby’s mansion. Or, rather, as I didn’t know Mr. Gatsby, it was a mansion inhabited by a gentleman of that name. My own house was an eyesore, but it was a small eyesore, and it had been overlooked, so I had a view of the water, a partial view of my neighbour’s lawn, and the consoling proximity of millionaires—all for eighty dollars a month.
</p>
<p>
Across the courtesy bay the white palaces of fashionable East Egg glittered along the water, and the history of the summer really begins on the evening I drove over there to have dinner with the Tom Buchanans. Daisy was my second cousin once removed, and I’d known Tom in college. And just after the war I spent two days with them in Chicago.
</p>
<p>
Her husband, among various physical accomplishments, had been one of the most powerful ends that ever played football at New Haven—a national figure in a way, one of those men who reach such an acute limited excellence at twenty-one that everything afterward savours of anticlimax. His family were enormously wealthy—even in college his freedom with money was a matter for reproach—but now he’d left Chicago and come East in a fashion that rather took your breath away: for instance, he’d brought down a string of polo ponies from Lake Forest. It was hard to realize that a man in my own generation was wealthy enough to do that.
</p>
<p>
Why they came East I don’t know. They had spent a year in France for no particular reason, and then drifted here and there unrestfully wherever people played polo and were rich together. This was a permanent move, said Daisy over the telephone, but I didn’t believe it—I had no sight into Daisy’s heart, but I felt that Tom would drift on forever seeking, a little wistfully, for the dramatic turbulence of some irrecoverable football game.
</p>
<p>
And so it happened that on a warm windy evening I drove over to East Egg to see two old friends whom I scarcely knew at all. Their house was even more elaborate than I expected, a cheerful red-and-white Georgian Colonial mansion, overlooking the bay. The lawn started at the beach and ran towards the front door for a quarter of a mile, jumping over sundials and brick walks and burning gardens—finally when it reached the house drifting up the side in bright vines as though from the momentum of its run. The front was broken by a line of French windows, glowing now with reflected gold and wide open to the warm windy afternoon, and Tom Buchanan in riding clothes was standing with his legs apart on the front porch.
</p>
<p>
He had changed since his New Haven years. Now he was a sturdy straw-haired man of thirty, with a rather hard mouth and a supercilious manner. Two shining arrogant eyes had established dominance over his face and gave him the appearance of always leaning aggressively forward. Not even the effeminate swank of his riding clothes could hide the enormous power of that body—he seemed to fill those glistening boots until he strained the top lacing, and you could see a great pack of muscle shifting when his shoulder moved under his thin coat. It was a body capable of enormous leverage—a cruel body.
</p>
<p>
His speaking voice, a gruff husky tenor, added to the impression of fractiousness he conveyed. There was a touch of paternal contempt in it, even toward people he liked—and there were men at New Haven who had hated his guts.
</p>
<p>
“Now, don’t think my opinion on these matters is final,” he seemed to say, “just because I’m stronger and more of a man than you are.” We were in the same senior society, and while we were never intimate I always had the impression that he approved of me and wanted me to like him with some harsh, defiant wistfulness of his own.
</p>
<p>
We talked for a few minutes on the sunny porch.
</p>
<p>
“I’ve got a nice place here,” he said, his eyes flashing about restlessly.
</p>
<p>
Turning me around by one arm, he moved a broad flat hand along the front vista, including in its sweep a sunken Italian garden, a half acre of deep, pungent roses, and a snub-nosed motorboat that bumped the tide offshore.
</p>
<p>
“It belonged to Demaine, the oil man.” He turned me around again, politely and abruptly. “We’ll go inside.”
</p>
<p>
We walked through a high hallway into a bright rosy-coloured space, fragilely bound into the house by French windows at either end. The windows were ajar and gleaming white against the fresh grass outside that seemed to grow a little way into the house. A breeze blew through the room, blew curtains in at one end and out the other like pale flags, twisting them up toward the frosted wedding-cake of the ceiling, and then rippled over the wine-coloured rug, making a shadow on it as wind does on the sea.
</p>
<p>
The only completely stationary object in the room was an enormous couch on which two young women were buoyed up as though upon an anchored balloon. They were both in white, and their dresses were rippling and fluttering as if they had just been blown back in after a short flight around the house. I must have stood for a few moments listening to the whip and snap of the curtains and the groan of a picture on the wall. Then there was a boom as Tom Buchanan shut the rear windows and the caught wind died out about the room, and the curtains and the rugs and the two young women ballooned slowly to the floor.
</p>
<p>
The younger of the two was a stranger to me. She was extended full length at her end of the divan, completely motionless, and with her chin raised a little, as if she were balancing something on it which was quite likely to fall. If she saw me out of the corner of her eyes she gave no hint of it—indeed, I was almost surprised into murmuring an apology for having disturbed her by coming in.
</p>
<p>
The other girl, Daisy, made an attempt to rise—she leaned slightly forward with a conscientious expression—then she laughed, an absurd, charming little laugh, and I laughed too and came forward into the room.
</p>
<p>
“I’m p-paralysed with happiness.”
</p>
<p>
She laughed again, as if she said something very witty, and held my hand for a moment, looking up into my face, promising that there was no one in the world she so much wanted to see. That was a way she had. She hinted in a murmur that the surname of the balancing girl was Baker. (I’ve heard it said that Daisy’s murmur was only to make people lean toward her; an irrelevant criticism that made it no less charming.)
</p>
<p>
At any rate, Miss Baker’s lips fluttered, she nodded at me almost imperceptibly, and then quickly tipped her head back again—the object she was balancing had obviously tottered a little and given her something of a fright. Again a sort of apology arose to my lips. Almost any exhibition of complete self-sufficiency draws a stunned tribute from me.
</p>
<p>
I looked back at my cousin, who began to ask me questions in her low, thrilling voice. It was the kind of voice that the ear follows up and down, as if each speech is an arrangement of notes that will never be played again. Her face was sad and lovely with bright things in it, bright eyes and a bright passionate mouth, but there was an excitement in her voice that men who had cared for her found difficult to forget: a singing compulsion, a whispered “Listen,” a promise that she had done gay, exciting things just a while since and that there were gay, exciting things hovering in the next hour.
</p>
<p>
I told her how I had stopped off in Chicago for a day on my way East, and how a dozen people had sent their love through me.
</p>
<p>
“Do they miss me?” she cried ecstatically.
</p>
<p>
“The whole town is desolate. All the cars have the left rear wheel painted black as a mourning wreath, and there’s a persistent wail all night along the north shore.”
</p>
<p>
“How gorgeous! Let’s go back, Tom. Tomorrow!” Then she added irrelevantly: “You ought to see the baby.”
</p>
<p>
“I’d like to.”
</p>
<p>
“She’s asleep. She’s three years old. Haven’t you ever seen her?”
</p>
<p>
“Never.”
</p>
<p>
“Well, you ought to see her. She’s—”
</p>
<p>
Tom Buchanan, who had been hovering restlessly about the room, stopped and rested his hand on my shoulder.
</p>
<p>
“What you doing, Nick?”
</p>
<p>
“I’m a bond man.”
</p>
<p>
“Who with?”
</p>
<p>
I told him.
</p>
<p>
“Never heard of them,” he remarked decisively.
</p>
<p>
This annoyed me.
</p>
<p>
“You will,” I answered shortly. “You will if you stay in the East.”
</p>
<p>
“Oh, I’ll stay in the East, don’t you worry,” he said, glancing at Daisy and then back at me, as if he were alert for something more. “I’d be a God damned fool to live anywhere else.”
</p>
<p>
At this point Miss Baker said: “Absolutely!” with such suddenness that I started—it was the first word she had uttered since I came into the room. Evidently it surprised her as much as it did me, for she yawned and with a series of rapid, deft movements stood up into the room.
</p>
<p>
“I’m stiff,” she complained, “I’ve been lying on that sofa for as long as I can remember.”
</p>
<p>
“Don’t look at me,” Daisy retorted, “I’ve been trying to get you to New York all afternoon.”
</p>
<p>
“No, thanks,” said Miss Baker to the four cocktails just in from the pantry. “I’m absolutely in training.”
</p>
<p>
Her host looked at her incredulously.
</p>
<p>
“You are!” He took down his drink as if it were a drop in the bottom of a glass. “How you ever get anything done is beyond me.”
</p>
<p>
I looked at Miss Baker, wondering what it was she “got done.” I enjoyed looking at her. She was a slender, small-breasted girl, with an erect carriage, which she accentuated by throwing her body backward at the shoulders like a young cadet. Her grey sun-strained eyes looked back at me with polite reciprocal curiosity out of a wan, charming, discontented face. It occurred to me now that I had seen her, or a picture of her, somewhere before.
</p>
<p>
“You live in West Egg,” she remarked contemptuously. “I know somebody there.”
</p>
<p>
“I don’t know a single—”
</p>
<p>
“You must know Gatsby.”
</p>
<p>
“Gatsby?” demanded Daisy. “What Gatsby?”
</p>
<p>
Before I could reply that he was my neighbour dinner was announced; wedging his tense arm imperatively under mine, Tom Buchanan compelled me from the room as though he were moving a checker to another square.
</p>
<p>
Slenderly, languidly, their hands set lightly on their hips, the two young women preceded us out on to a rosy-coloured porch, open toward the sunset, where four candles flickered on the table in the diminished wind.
</p>
<p>
“Why <i>candles</i>?” objected Daisy, frowning. She snapped them out with her fingers. “In two weeks it’ll be the longest day in the year.” She looked at us all radiantly. “Do you always watch for the longest day of the year and then miss it? I always watch for the longest day in the year and then miss it.”
</p>
<p>
“We ought to plan something,” yawned Miss Baker, sitting down at the table as if she were getting into bed.
</p>
<p>
“All right,” said Daisy. “What’ll we plan?” She turned to me helplessly: “What do people plan?”
</p>
<p>
Before I could answer her eyes fastened with an awed expression on her little finger.
</p>
<p>
“Look!” she complained; “I hurt it.”
</p>
<p>
We all looked—the knuckle was black and blue.
</p>
<p>
“You did it, Tom,” she said accusingly. “I know you didn’t mean to, but you <i>did</i> do it. That’s what I get for marrying a brute of a man, a great, big, hulking physical specimen of a—”
</p>
<p>
“I hate that word ‘hulking,’ ” objected Tom crossly, “even in kidding.”
</p>
<p>
“Hulking,” insisted Daisy.
</p>
<p>
Sometimes she and Miss Baker talked at once, unobtrusively and with a bantering inconsequence that was never quite chatter, that was as cool as their white dresses and their impersonal eyes in the absence of all desire. They were here, and they accepted Tom and me, making only a polite pleasant effort to entertain or to be entertained. They knew that presently dinner would be over and a little later the evening too would be over and casually put away. It was sharply different from the West, where an evening was hurried from phase to phase towards its close, in a continually disappointed anticipation or else in sheer nervous dread of the moment itself.
</p>
<p>
“You make me feel uncivilized, Daisy,” I confessed on my second glass of corky but rather impressive claret. “Can’t you talk about crops or something?”
</p>
<p>
I meant nothing in particular by this remark, but it was taken up in an unexpected way.
</p>
<p>
“Civilization’s going to pieces,” broke out Tom violently. “I’ve gotten to be a terrible pessimist about things. Have you read <i>The Rise of the Coloured Empires</i> by this man Goddard?”
</p>
<p>
“Why, no,” I answered, rather surprised by his tone.
</p>
<p>
“Well, it’s a fine book, and everybody ought to read it. The idea is if we don’t look out the white race will be—will be utterly submerged. It’s all scientific stuff; it’s been proved.”
</p>
<p>
“Tom’s getting very profound,” said Daisy, with an expression of unthoughtful sadness. “He reads deep books with long words in them. What was that word we—”
</p>
<p>
“Well, these books are all scientific,” insisted Tom, glancing at her impatiently. “This fellow has worked out the whole thing. It’s up to us, who are the dominant race, to watch out or these other races will have control of things.”
</p>
<p>
“We’ve got to beat them down,” whispered Daisy, winking ferociously toward the fervent sun.
</p>
<p>
“You ought to live in California—” began Miss Baker, but Tom interrupted her by shifting heavily in his chair.
</p>
<p>
“This idea is that we’re Nordics. I am, and you are, and you are, and—” After an infinitesimal hesitation he included Daisy with a slight nod, and she winked at me again. “—And we’ve produced all the things that go to make civilization—oh, science and art, and all that. Do you see?”
</p>
<p>
There was something pathetic in his concentration, as if his complacency, more acute than of old, was not enough to him any more. When, almost immediately, the telephone rang inside and the butler left the porch Daisy seized upon the momentary interruption and leaned towards me.
</p>
<p>
“I’ll tell you a family secret,” she whispered enthusiastically. “It’s about the butler’s nose. Do you want to hear about the butler’s nose?”
</p>
<p>
“That’s why I came over tonight.”
</p>
<p>
“Well, he wasn’t always a butler; he used to be the silver polisher for some people in New York that had a silver service for two hundred people. He had to polish it from morning till night, until finally it began to affect his nose—”
</p>
<p>
“Things went from bad to worse,” suggested Miss Baker.
</p>
<p>
“Yes. Things went from bad to worse, until finally he had to give up his position.”
</p>
<p>
For a moment the last sunshine fell with romantic affection upon her glowing face; her voice compelled me forward breathlessly as I listened—then the glow faded, each light deserting her with lingering regret, like children leaving a pleasant street at dusk.
</p>
<p>
The butler came back and murmured something close to Tom’s ear, whereupon Tom frowned, pushed back his chair, and without a word went inside. As if his absence quickened something within her, Daisy leaned forward again, her voice glowing and singing.
</p>
<p>
“I love to see you at my table, Nick. You remind me of a—of a rose, an absolute rose. Doesn’t he?” She turned to Miss Baker for confirmation: “An absolute rose?”
</p>
<p>
This was untrue. I am not even faintly like a rose. She was only extemporizing, but a stirring warmth flowed from her, as if her heart was trying to come out to you concealed in one of those breathless, thrilling words. Then suddenly she threw her napkin on the table and excused herself and went into the house.
</p>
<p>
Miss Baker and I exchanged a short glance consciously devoid of meaning. I was about to speak when she sat up alertly and said “<i>Sh!</i>” in a warning voice. A subdued impassioned murmur was audible in the room beyond, and Miss Baker leaned forward unashamed, trying to hear. The murmur trembled on the verge of coherence, sank down, mounted excitedly, and then ceased altogether.
</p>
<p>
“This Mr. Gatsby you spoke of is my neighbour—” I began.
</p>
<p>
“Don’t talk. I want to hear what happens.”
</p>
<p>
“Is something happening?” I inquired innocently.
</p>
<p>
“You mean to say you don’t know?” said Miss Baker, honestly surprised. “I thought everybody knew.”
</p>
<p>
“I don’t.”
</p>
<p>
“Why—” she said hesitantly. “Tom’s got some woman in New York.”
</p>
<p>
“Got some woman?” I repeated blankly.
</p>
<p>
Miss Baker nodded.
</p>
<p>
“She might have the decency not to telephone him at dinner time. Don’t you think?”
</p>
<p>
Almost before I had grasped her meaning there was the flutter of a dress and the crunch of leather boots, and Tom and Daisy were back at the table.
</p>
<p>
“It couldn’t be helped!” cried Daisy with tense gaiety.
</p>
<p>
She sat down, glanced searchingly at Miss Baker and then at me, and continued: “I looked outdoors for a minute, and it’s very romantic outdoors. There’s a bird on the lawn that I think must be a nightingale come over on the Cunard or White Star Line. He’s singing away—” Her voice sang: “It’s romantic, isn’t it, Tom?”
</p>
<p>
“Very romantic,” he said, and then miserably to me: “If it’s light enough after dinner, I want to take you down to the stables.”
</p>
<p>
The telephone rang inside, startlingly, and as Daisy shook her head decisively at Tom the subject of the stables, in fact all subjects, vanished into air. Among the broken fragments of the last five minutes at table I remember the candles being lit again, pointlessly, and I was conscious of wanting to look squarely at everyone, and yet to avoid all eyes. I couldn’t guess what Daisy and Tom were thinking, but I doubt if even Miss Baker, who seemed to have mastered a certain hardy scepticism, was able utterly to put this fifth guest’s shrill metallic urgency out of mind. To a certain temperament the situation might have seemed intriguing—my own instinct was to telephone immediately for the police.
</p>
<p>
The horses, needless to say, were not mentioned again. Tom and Miss Baker, with several feet of twilight between them, strolled back into the library, as if to a vigil beside a perfectly tangible body, while, trying to look pleasantly interested and a little deaf, I followed Daisy around a chain of connecting verandas to the porch in front. In its deep gloom we sat down side by side on a wicker settee.
</p>
<p>
Daisy took her face in her hands as if feeling its lovely shape, and her eyes moved gradually out into the velvet dusk. I saw that turbulent emotions possessed her, so I asked what I thought would be some sedative questions about her little girl.
</p>
<p>
“We don’t know each other very well, Nick,” she said suddenly. “Even if we are cousins. You didn’t come to my wedding.”
</p>
<p>
“I wasn’t back from the war.”
</p>
<p>
“That’s true.” She hesitated. “Well, I’ve had a very bad time, Nick, and I’m pretty cynical about everything.”
</p>
<p>
Evidently she had reason to be. I waited but she didn’t say any more, and after a moment I returned rather feebly to the subject of her daughter.
</p>
<p>
“I suppose she talks, and—eats, and everything.”
</p>
<p>
“Oh, yes.” She looked at me absently. “Listen, Nick; let me tell you what I said when she was born. Would you like to hear?”
</p>
<p>
“Very much.”
</p>
<p>
“It’ll show you how I’ve gotten to feel about—things. Well, she was less than an hour old and Tom was God knows where. I woke up out of the ether with an utterly abandoned feeling, and asked the nurse right away if it was a boy or a girl. She told me it was a girl, and so I turned my head away and wept. ‘All right,’ I said, ‘I’m glad it’s a girl. And I hope she’ll be a fool—that’s the best thing a girl can be in this world, a beautiful little fool.’
</p>
<p>
“You see I think everything’s terrible anyhow,” she went on in a convinced way. “Everybody thinks so—the most advanced people. And I <i>know</i>. I’ve been everywhere and seen everything and done everything.” Her eyes flashed around her in a defiant way, rather like Tom’s, and she laughed with thrilling scorn. “Sophisticated—God, I’m sophisticated!”
</p>
<p>
The instant her voice broke off, ceasing to compel my attention, my belief, I felt the basic insincerity of what she had said. It made me uneasy, as though the whole evening had been a trick of some sort to exact a contributory emotion from me. I waited, and sure enough, in a moment she looked at me with an absolute smirk on her lovely face, as if she had asserted her membership in a rather distinguished secret society to which she and Tom belonged.
</p>
<hr>
<p>
Inside, the crimson room bloomed with light. Tom and Miss Baker sat at either end of the long couch and she read aloud to him from the <i>Saturday Evening Post</i>—the words, murmurous and uninflected, running together in a soothing tune. The lamplight, bright on his boots and dull on the autumn-leaf yellow of her hair, glinted along the paper as she turned a page with a flutter of slender muscles in her arms.
</p>
<p>
When we came in she held us silent for a moment with a lifted hand.
</p>
<p>
“To be continued,” she said, tossing the magazine on the table, “in our very next issue.”
</p>
<p>
Her body asserted itself with a restless movement of her knee, and she stood up.
</p>
<p>
“Ten o’clock,” she remarked, apparently finding the time on the ceiling. “Time for this good girl to go to bed.”
</p>
<p>
“Jordan’s going to play in the tournament tomorrow,” explained Daisy, “over at Westchester.”
</p>
<p>
“Oh—you’re <i>Jor</i>dan Baker.”
</p>
<p>
I knew now why her face was familiar—its pleasing contemptuous expression had looked out at me from many rotogravure pictures of the sporting life at Asheville and Hot Springs and Palm Beach. I had heard some story of her too, a critical, unpleasant story, but what it was I had forgotten long ago.
</p>
<p>
“Good night,” she said softly. “Wake me at eight, won’t you.”
</p>
<p>
“If you’ll get up.”
</p>
<p>
“I will. Good night, Mr. Carraway. See you anon.”
</p>
<p>
“Of course you will,” confirmed Daisy. “In fact I think I’ll arrange a marriage. Come over often, Nick, and I’ll sort of—oh—fling you together. You know—lock you up accidentally in linen closets and push you out to sea in a boat, and all that sort of thing—”
</p>
<p>
“Good night,” called Miss Baker from the stairs. “I haven’t heard a word.”
</p>
<p>
“She’s a nice girl,” said Tom after a moment. “They oughtn’t to let her run around the country this way.”
</p>
<p>
“Who oughtn’t to?” inquired Daisy coldly.
</p>
<p>
“Her family.”
</p>
<p>
“Her family is one aunt about a thousand years old. Besides, Nick’s going to look after her, aren’t you, Nick? She’s going to spend lots of weekends out here this summer. I think the home influence will be very good for her.”
</p>
<p>
Daisy and Tom looked at each other for a moment in silence.
</p>
<p>
“Is she from New York?” I asked quickly.
</p>
<p>
“From Louisville. Our white girlhood was passed together there. Our beautiful white—”
</p>
<p>
“Did you give Nick a little heart to heart talk on the veranda?” demanded Tom suddenly.
</p>
<p>
“Did I?” She looked at me. “I can’t seem to remember, but I think we talked about the Nordic race. Yes, I’m sure we did. It sort of crept up on us and first thing you know—”
</p>
<p>
“Don’t believe everything you hear, Nick,” he advised me.
</p>
<p>
I said lightly that I had heard nothing at all, and a few minutes later I got up to go home. They came to the door with me and stood side by side in a cheerful square of light. As I started my motor Daisy peremptorily called: “Wait!
</p>
<p>
“I forgot to ask you something, and it’s important. We heard you were engaged to a girl out West.”
</p>
<p>
“That’s right,” corroborated Tom kindly. “We heard that you were engaged.”
</p>
<p>
“It’s a libel. I’m too poor.”
</p>
<p>
“But we heard it,” insisted Daisy, surprising me by opening up again in a flower-like way. “We heard it from three people, so it must be true.”
</p>
<p>
Of course I knew what they were referring to, but I wasn’t even vaguely engaged. The fact that gossip had published the banns was one of the reasons I had come East. You can’t stop going with an old friend on account of rumours, and on the other hand I had no intention of being rumoured into marriage.
</p>
<p>
Their interest rather touched me and made them less remotely rich—nevertheless, I was confused and a little disgusted as I drove away. It seemed to me that the thing for Daisy to do was to rush out of the house, child in arms—but apparently there were no such intentions in her head. As for Tom, the fact that he “had some woman in New York” was really less surprising than that he had been depressed by a book. Something was making him nibble at the edge of stale ideas as if his sturdy physical egotism no longer nourished his peremptory heart.
</p>
<p>
Already it was deep summer on roadhouse roofs and in front of wayside garages, where new red petrol-pumps sat out in pools of light, and when I reached my estate at West Egg I ran the car under its shed and sat for a while on an abandoned grass roller in the yard. The wind had blown off, leaving a loud, bright night, with wings beating in the trees and a persistent organ sound as the full bellows of the earth blew the frogs full of life. The silhouette of a moving cat wavered across the moonlight, and, turning my head to watch it, I saw that I was not alone—fifty feet away a figure had emerged from the shadow of my neighbour’s mansion and was standing with his hands in his pockets regarding the silver pepper of the stars. Something in his leisurely movements and the secure position of his feet upon the lawn suggested that it was Mr. Gatsby himself, come out to determine what share was his of our local heavens.
</p>
<p>
I decided to call to him. Miss Baker had mentioned him at dinner, and that would do for an introduction. But I didn’t call to him, for he gave a sudden intimation that he was content to be alone—he stretched out his arms toward the dark water in a curious way, and, far as I was from him, I could have sworn he was trembling. Involuntarily I glanced seaward—and distinguished nothing except a single green light, minute and far away, that might have been the end of a dock. When I looked once more for Gatsby he had vanished, and I was alone again in the unquiet darkness.

          <small>JONATHAN HARKER’S JOURNAL</small></h2>
          <p class="c">(<i>Kept in shorthand.</i>)</p>
          <p><i>3 May. Bistritz.</i>—Left Munich at 8:35 <span class="smcap">P. M.</span>, on 1st May, arriving at
          Vienna early next morning; should have arrived at 6:46, but train was an
          hour late. Buda-Pesth seems a wonderful place, from the glimpse which I
          got of it from the train and the little I could walk through the
          streets. I feared to go very far from the station, as we had arrived
          late and would start as near the correct time as possible. The
          impression I had was that we were leaving the West and entering the
          East; the most western of splendid bridges over the Danube, which is
          here of noble width and depth, took us among the traditions of Turkish
          rule.</p>
          <p>We left in pretty good time, and came after nightfall to Klausenburgh.
          Here I stopped for the night at the Hotel Royale. I had for dinner, or
          rather supper, a chicken done up some way with red pepper, which was
          very good but thirsty. (<i>Mem.</i>, get recipe for Mina.) I asked the
          waiter, and he said it was called “paprika hendl,” and that, as it was a
          national dish, I should be able to get it anywhere along the
          Carpathians. I found my smattering of German very useful here; indeed, I
          don’t know how I should be able to get on without it.</p>
          <p>Having had some time at my disposal when in London, I had visited the
          British Museum, and made search among the books and maps in the library
          regarding Transylvania; it had struck me that some foreknowledge of the
          country could hardly fail to have some importance in dealing with a
          nobleman of that country. I find that the district he named is in the
          extreme east of the country, just on the borders of three states,
          Transylvania, Moldavia and Bukovina, in the midst of the Carpathian
          mountains; one of the wildest and least known portions of Europe. I was
          not able to light on any map or work giving the exact locality of the
          Castle Dracula, as there are no maps of this country as yet to compare
          with our own Ordnance Survey maps; but I found that Bistritz, the post
          town named by Count Dracula, is a fairly well-known place. I shall enter
          here some of my notes, as they may refresh my memory when I talk over my
          travels with Mina.</p>
          <p>In the population of Transylvania there are four distinct nationalities:
          Saxons in the South, and mixed with them the Wallachs, who are the
          descendants of the Dacians; Magyars in the West, and Szekelys in the
          East and North. I am going among the latter, who claim to be descended
          from Attila and the Huns. This may be so, for when the Magyars conquered
          the country in the eleventh century they found the Huns settled in it. I
          read that every known superstition in the world is gathered into the
          horseshoe of the Carpathians, as if it were the centre of some sort of
          imaginative whirlpool; if so my stay may be very interesting. (<i>Mem.</i>, I
          must ask the Count all about them.)</p>
          <p>I did not sleep well, though my bed was comfortable enough, for I had
          all sorts of queer dreams. There was a dog howling all night under my
          window, which may have had something to do with it; or it may have been
          the paprika, for I had to drink up all the water in my carafe, and was
          still thirsty. Towards morning I slept and was wakened by the continuous
          knocking at my door, so I guess I must have been sleeping soundly then.
          I had for breakfast more paprika, and a sort of porridge of maize flour
          which they said was “mamaliga,” and egg-plant stuffed with forcemeat, a
          very excellent dish, which they call “impletata.” (<i>Mem.</i>, get recipe
          for this also.) I had to hurry breakfast, for the train started a little
          before eight, or rather it ought to have done so, for after rushing to
          the station at 7:30 I had to sit in the carriage for more than an hour
          before we began to move. It seems to me that the further east you go the
          more unpunctual are the trains. What ought they to be in China?</p>
          <p>All day long we seemed to dawdle through a country which was full of
          beauty of every kind. Sometimes we saw little towns or castles on the
          top of steep hills such as we see in old missals; sometimes we ran by
          rivers and streams which seemed from the wide stony margin on each side
          of them to be subject to great floods. It takes a lot of water, and
          running strong, to sweep the outside edge of a river clear. At every
          station there were groups of people, sometimes crowds, and in all sorts
          of attire. Some of them were just like the peasants at home or those I
          saw coming through France and Germany, with short jackets and round hats
          and home-made trousers; but others were very picturesque. The women
          looked pretty, except when you got near them, but they were very clumsy
          about the waist. They had all full white sleeves of some kind or other,
          and most of them had big belts with a lot of strips of something
          fluttering from them like the dresses in a ballet, but of course there
          were petticoats under them. The strangest figures we saw were the
          Slovaks, who were more barbarian than the rest, with their big cow-boy
          hats, great baggy dirty-white trousers, white linen shirts, and enormous
          heavy leather belts, nearly a foot wide, all studded over with brass
          nails. They wore high boots, with their trousers tucked into them, and
          had long black hair and heavy black moustaches. They are very
          picturesque, but do not look prepossessing. On the stage they would be
          set down at once as some old Oriental band of brigands. They are,
          however, I am told, very harmless and rather wanting in natural
          self-assertion.</p>
          <p>It was on the dark side of twilight when we got to Bistritz, which is a
          very interesting old place. Being practically on the frontier—for the
          Borgo Pass leads from it into Bukovina—it has had a very stormy
          existence, and it certainly shows marks of it. Fifty years ago a series
          of great fires took place, which made terrible havoc on five separate
          occasions. At the very beginning of the seventeenth century it underwent
          a siege of three weeks and lost 13,000 people, the casualties of war
          proper being assisted by famine and disease.</p>
          <p>Count Dracula had directed me to go to the Golden Krone Hotel, which I
          found, to my great delight, to be thoroughly old-fashioned, for of
          course I wanted to see all I could of the ways of the country. I was
          evidently expected, for when I got near the door I faced a
          cheery-looking elderly woman in the usual peasant dress—white
          undergarment with long double apron, front, and back, of coloured stuff
          fitting almost too tight for modesty. When I came close she bowed and
          said, “The Herr Englishman?” “Yes,” I said, “Jonathan Harker.” She
          smiled, and gave some message to an elderly man in white shirt-sleeves,
          who had followed her to the door. He went, but immediately returned with
          a letter:—</p>
          <div class="blockquot"><p>“My Friend.—Welcome to the Carpathians. I am anxiously expecting
          you. Sleep well to-night. At three to-morrow the diligence will
          start for Bukovina; a place on it is kept for you. At the Borgo
          Pass my carriage will await you and will bring you to me. I trust
          that your journey from London has been a happy one, and that you
          will enjoy your stay in my beautiful land.</p>
          <p class="r">
          “Your friend,<br>
          “<span class="smcap">Dracula</span>.”<br> 
          </p></div>
      </div>
      <p><i>4 May.</i>—I found that my landlord had got a letter from the Count,
        directing him to secure the best place on the coach for me; but on
        making inquiries as to details he seemed somewhat reticent, and
        pretended that he could not understand my German. This could not be
        true, because up to then he had understood it perfectly; at least, he
        answered my questions exactly as if he did. He and his wife, the old
        lady who had received me, looked at each other in a frightened sort of
        way. He mumbled out that the money had been sent in a letter, and that
        was all he knew. When I asked him if he knew Count Dracula, and could
        tell me anything of his castle, both he and his wife crossed themselves,
        and, saying that they knew nothing at all, simply refused to speak
        further. It was so near the time of starting that I had no time to ask
        any one else, for it was all very mysterious and not by any means
        comforting.</p>
        <p>Just before I was leaving, the old lady came up to my room and said in a
        very hysterical way:</p>
        <p>“Must you go? Oh! young Herr, must you go?” She was in such an excited
        state that she seemed to have lost her grip of what German she knew, and
        mixed it all up with some other language which I did not know at all. I
        was just able to follow her by asking many questions. When I told her
        that I must go at once, and that I was engaged on important business,
        she asked again:</p>
        <p>“Do you know what day it is?” I answered that it was the fourth of May.
        She shook her head as she said again:</p>
        <p>“Oh, yes! I know that! I know that, but do you know what day it is?” On
        my saying that I did not understand, she went on:</p>
        <p>“It is the eve of St. George’s Day. Do you not know that to-night, when
        the clock strikes midnight, all the evil things in the world will have
        full sway? Do you know where you are going, and what you are going to?”
        She was in such evident distress that I tried to comfort her, but
        without effect. Finally she went down on her knees and implored me not
        to go; at least to wait a day or two before starting. It was all very
        ridiculous but I did not feel comfortable. However, there was business
        to be done, and I could allow nothing to interfere with it. I therefore
        tried to raise her up, and said, as gravely as I could, that I thanked
        her, but my duty was imperative, and that I must go. She then rose and
        dried her eyes, and taking a crucifix from her neck offered it to me. I
        did not know what to do, for, as an English Churchman, I have been
        taught to regard such things as in some measure idolatrous, and yet it
        seemed so ungracious to refuse an old lady meaning so well and in such a
        state of mind. She saw, I suppose, the doubt in my face, for she put the
        rosary round my neck, and said, “For your mother’s sake,” and went out
        of the room. I am writing up this part of the diary whilst I am waiting
        for the coach, which is, of course, late; and the crucifix is still
        round my neck. Whether it is the old lady’s fear, or the many ghostly
        traditions of this place, or the crucifix itself, I do not know, but I
        am not feeling nearly as easy in my mind as usual. If this book should
        ever reach Mina before I do, let it bring my good-bye. Here comes the
        coach!</p>
        <p> </p>
        <p><i>5 May. The Castle.</i>—The grey of the morning has passed, and the sun is
        high over the distant horizon, which seems jagged, whether with trees or
        hills I know not, for it is so far off that big things and little are
        mixed. I am not sleepy, and, as I am not to be called till I awake,
        naturally I write till sleep comes. There are many odd things to put
        down, and, lest who reads them may fancy that I dined too well before I
        left Bistritz, let me put down my dinner exactly. I dined on what they
        called “robber steak”—bits of bacon, onion, and beef, seasoned with red
        pepper, and strung on sticks and roasted over the fire, in the simple
        style of the London cat’s meat! The wine was Golden Mediasch, which
        produces a queer sting on the tongue, which is, however, not
        disagreeable. I had only a couple of glasses of this, and nothing else.</p>
        <p>When I got on the coach the driver had not taken his seat, and I saw him
        talking with the landlady. They were evidently talking of me, for every
        now and then they looked at me, and some of the people who were sitting
        on the bench outside the door—which they call by a name meaning
        “word-bearer”—came and listened, and then looked at me, most of them
        pityingly. I could hear a lot of words often repeated, queer words, for
        there were many nationalities in the crowd; so I quietly got my polyglot
        dictionary from my bag and looked them out. I must say they were not
        cheering to me, for amongst them were “Ordog”—Satan, “pokol”—hell,
        “stregoica”—witch, “vrolok” and “vlkoslak”—both of which mean the same
        thing, one being Slovak and the other Servian for something that is
        either were-wolf or vampire. (<i>Mem.</i>, I must ask the Count about these
        superstitions)</p>
        <p>When we started, the crowd round the inn door, which had by this time
        swelled to a considerable size, all made the sign of the cross and
        pointed two fingers towards me. With some difficulty I got a
        fellow-passenger to tell me what they meant; he would not answer at
        first, but on learning that I was English, he explained that it was a
        charm or guard against the evil eye. This was not very pleasant for me,
        just starting for an unknown place to meet an unknown man; but every one
        seemed so kind-hearted, and so sorrowful, and so sympathetic that I
        could not but be touched. I shall never forget the last glimpse which I
        had of the inn-yard and its crowd of picturesque figures, all crossing
        themselves, as they stood round the wide archway, with its background of
        rich foliage of oleander and orange trees in green tubs clustered in the
        centre of the yard. Then our driver, whose wide linen drawers covered
        the whole front of the box-seat—“gotza” they call them—cracked his big
        whip over his four small horses, which ran abreast, and we set off on
        our journey.</p>
        <p>I soon lost sight and recollection of ghostly fears in the beauty of the
        scene as we drove along, although had I known the language, or rather
        languages, which my fellow-passengers were speaking, I might not have
        been able to throw them off so easily. Before us lay a green sloping
        land full of forests and woods, with here and there steep hills, crowned
        with clumps of trees or with farmhouses, the blank gable end to the
        road. There was everywhere a bewildering mass of fruit blossom—apple,
        plum, pear, cherry; and as we drove by I could see the green grass under
        the trees spangled with the fallen petals. In and out amongst these
        green hills of what they call here the “Mittel Land” ran the road,
        losing itself as it swept round the grassy curve, or was shut out by the
        straggling ends of pine woods, which here and there ran down the
        hillsides like tongues of flame. The road was rugged, but still we
        seemed to fly over it with a feverish haste. I could not understand then
        what the haste meant, but the driver was evidently bent on losing no
        time in reaching Borgo Prund. I was told that this road is in summertime
        excellent, but that it had not yet been put in order after the winter
        snows. In this respect it is different from the general run of roads in
        the Carpathians, for it is an old tradition that they are not to be kept
        in too good order. Of old the Hospadars would not repair them, lest the
        Turk should think that they were preparing to bring in foreign troops,
        and so hasten the war which was always really at loading point.</p>
        <p>Beyond the green swelling hills of the Mittel Land rose mighty slopes
        of forest up to the lofty steeps of the Carpathians themselves. Right
        and left of us they towered, with the afternoon sun falling full upon
        them and bringing out all the glorious colours of this beautiful range,
        deep blue and purple in the shadows of the peaks, green and brown where
        grass and rock mingled, and an endless perspective of jagged rock and
        pointed crags, till these were themselves lost in the distance, where
        the snowy peaks rose grandly. Here and there seemed mighty rifts in the
        mountains, through which, as the sun began to sink, we saw now and again
        the white gleam of falling water. One of my companions touched my arm as
        we swept round the base of a hill and opened up the lofty, snow-covered
        peak of a mountain, which seemed, as we wound on our serpentine way, to
        be right before us:—</p>
        <p>“Look! Isten szek!”—“God’s seat!”—and he crossed himself reverently.</p>
        <p>As we wound on our endless way, and the sun sank lower and lower behind
        us, the shadows of the evening began to creep round us. This was
        emphasised by the fact that the snowy mountain-top still held the
        sunset, and seemed to glow out with a delicate cool pink. Here and there
        we passed Cszeks and Slovaks, all in picturesque attire, but I noticed
        that goitre was painfully prevalent. By the roadside were many crosses,
        and as we swept by, my companions all crossed themselves. Here and there
        was a peasant man or woman kneeling before a shrine, who did not even
        turn round as we approached, but seemed in the self-surrender of
        devotion to have neither eyes nor ears for the outer world. There were
        many things new to me: for instance, hay-ricks in the trees, and here
        and there very beautiful masses of weeping birch, their white stems
        shining like silver through the delicate green of the leaves. Now and
        again we passed a leiter-wagon—the ordinary peasant’s cart—with its
        long, snake-like vertebra, calculated to suit the inequalities of the
        road. On this were sure to be seated quite a group of home-coming
        peasants, the Cszeks with their white, and the Slovaks with their
        coloured, sheepskins, the latter carrying lance-fashion their long
        staves, with axe at end. As the evening fell it began to get very cold,
        and the growing twilight seemed to merge into one dark mistiness the
        gloom of the trees, oak, beech, and pine, though in the valleys which
        ran deep between the spurs of the hills, as we ascended through the
        Pass, the dark firs stood out here and there against the background of
        late-lying snow. Sometimes, as the road was cut through the pine woods
        that seemed in the darkness to be closing down upon us, great masses of
        greyness, which here and there bestrewed the trees, produced a
        peculiarly weird and solemn effect, which carried on the thoughts and
        grim fancies engendered earlier in the evening, when the falling sunset
        threw into strange relief the ghost-like clouds which amongst the
        Carpathians seem to wind ceaselessly through the valleys. Sometimes the
        hills were so steep that, despite our driver’s haste, the horses could
        only go slowly. I wished to get down and walk up them, as we do at home,
        but the driver would not hear of it. “No, no,” he said; “you must not
        walk here; the dogs are too fierce”; and then he added, with what he
        evidently meant for grim pleasantry—for he looked round to catch the
        approving smile of the rest—“and you may have enough of such matters
        before you go to sleep.” The only stop he would make was a moment’s
        pause to light his lamps.</p>
        <p>When it grew dark there seemed to be some excitement amongst the
        passengers, and they kept speaking to him, one after the other, as
        though urging him to further speed. He lashed the horses unmercifully
        with his long whip, and with wild cries of encouragement urged them on
        to further exertions. Then through the darkness I could see a sort of
        patch of grey light ahead of us, as though there were a cleft in the
        hills. The excitement of the passengers grew greater; the crazy coach
        rocked on its great leather springs, and swayed like a boat tossed on a
        stormy sea. I had to hold on. The road grew more level, and we appeared
        to fly along. Then the mountains seemed to come nearer to us on each
        side and to frown down upon us; we were entering on the Borgo Pass. One
        by one several of the passengers offered me gifts, which they pressed
        upon me with an earnestness which would take no denial; these were
        certainly of an odd and varied kind, but each was given in simple good
        faith, with a kindly word, and a blessing, and that strange mixture of
        fear-meaning movements which I had seen outside the hotel at
        Bistritz—the sign of the cross and the guard against the evil eye.
        Then, as we flew along, the driver leaned forward, and on each side the
        passengers, craning over the edge of the coach, peered eagerly into the
        darkness. It was evident that something very exciting was either
        happening or expected, but though I asked each passenger, no one would
        give me the slightest explanation. This state of excitement kept on for
        some little time; and at last we saw before us the Pass opening out on
        the eastern side. There were dark, rolling clouds overhead, and in the
        air the heavy, oppressive sense of thunder. It seemed as though the
        mountain range had separated two atmospheres, and that now we had got
        into the thunderous one. I was now myself looking out for the conveyance
        which was to take me to the Count. Each moment I expected to see the
        glare of lamps through the blackness; but all was dark. The only light
        was the flickering rays of our own lamps, in which the steam from our
        hard-driven horses rose in a white cloud. We could see now the sandy
        road lying white before us, but there was on it no sign of a vehicle.
        The passengers drew back with a sigh of gladness, which seemed to mock
        my own disappointment. I was already thinking what I had best do, when
        the driver, looking at his watch, said to the others something which I
        could hardly hear, it was spoken so quietly and in so low a tone; I
        thought it was “An hour less than the time.” Then turning to me, he said
        in German worse than my own:—</p>
        <p>“There is no carriage here. The Herr is not expected after all. He will
        now come on to Bukovina, and return to-morrow or the next day; better
        the next day.” Whilst he was speaking the horses began to neigh and
        snort and plunge wildly, so that the driver had to hold them up. Then,
        amongst a chorus of screams from the peasants and a universal crossing
        of themselves, a calèche, with four horses, drove up behind us, overtook
        us, and drew up beside the coach. I could see from the flash of our
        lamps, as the rays fell on them, that the horses were coal-black and
        splendid animals. They were driven by a tall man, with a long brown
        beard and a great black hat, which seemed to hide his face from us. I
        could only see the gleam of a pair of very bright eyes, which seemed red
        in the lamplight, as he turned to us. He said to the driver:—</p>
        <p>“You are early to-night, my friend.” The man stammered in reply:—</p>
        <p>“The English Herr was in a hurry,” to which the stranger replied:—</p>
        <p>“That is why, I suppose, you wished him to go on to Bukovina. You cannot
        deceive me, my friend; I know too much, and my horses are swift.” As he
        spoke he smiled, and the lamplight fell on a hard-looking mouth, with
        very red lips and sharp-looking teeth, as white as ivory. One of my
        companions whispered to another the line from Burger’s “Lenore”:—</p>
        <div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
        <span class="i0">“Denn die Todten reiten schnell”—<br></span>
        <span class="i0">(“For the dead travel fast.”)<br></span>
        </div></div>
        <p class="nind">The strange driver evidently heard the words, for he looked up with a
        gleaming smile. The passenger turned his face away, at the same time
        putting out his two fingers and crossing himself. “Give me the Herr’s
        luggage,” said the driver; and with exceeding alacrity my bags were
        handed out and put in the calèche. Then I descended from the side of the
        coach, as the calèche was close alongside, the driver helping me with a
        hand which caught my arm in a grip of steel; his strength must have been
        prodigious. Without a word he shook his reins, the horses turned, and we
        swept into the darkness of the Pass. As I looked back I saw the steam
        from the horses of the coach by the light of the lamps, and projected
        against it the figures of my late companions crossing themselves. Then
        the driver cracked his whip and called to his horses, and off they swept
        on their way to Bukovina. As they sank into the darkness I felt a
        strange chill, and a lonely feeling came over me; but a cloak was thrown
        over my shoulders, and a rug across my knees, and the driver said in
        excellent German:—</p>
        <p>“The night is chill, mein Herr, and my master the Count bade me take all
        care of you. There is a flask of slivovitz (the plum brandy of the
        country) underneath the seat, if you should require it.” I did not take
        any, but it was a comfort to know it was there all the same. I felt a
        little strangely, and not a little frightened. I think had there been
        any alternative I should have taken it, instead of prosecuting that
        unknown night journey. The carriage went at a hard pace straight along,
        then we made a complete turn and went along another straight road. It
        seemed to me that we were simply going over and over the same ground
        again; and so I took note of some salient point, and found that this was
        so. I would have liked to have asked the driver what this all meant, but
        I really feared to do so, for I thought that, placed as I was, any
        protest would have had no effect in case there had been an intention to
        delay. By-and-by, however, as I was curious to know how time was
        passing, I struck a match, and by its flame looked at my watch; it was
        within a few minutes of midnight. This gave me a sort of shock, for I
        suppose the general superstition about midnight was increased by my
        recent experiences. I waited with a sick feeling of suspense.</p>
        <p>Then a dog began to howl somewhere in a farmhouse far down the road—a
        long, agonised wailing, as if from fear. The sound was taken up by
        another dog, and then another and another, till, borne on the wind which
        now sighed softly through the Pass, a wild howling began, which seemed
        to come from all over the country, as far as the imagination could grasp
        it through the gloom of the night. At the first howl the horses began to
        strain and rear, but the driver spoke to them soothingly, and they
        quieted down, but shivered and sweated as though after a runaway from
        sudden fright. Then, far off in the distance, from the mountains on each
        side of us began a louder and a sharper howling—that of wolves—which
        affected both the horses and myself in the same way—for I was minded to
        jump from the calèche and run, whilst they reared again and plunged
        madly, so that the driver had to use all his great strength to keep them
        from bolting. In a few minutes, however, my own ears got accustomed to
        the sound, and the horses so far became quiet that the driver was able
        to descend and to stand before them. He petted and soothed them, and
        whispered something in their ears, as I have heard of horse-tamers
        doing, and with extraordinary effect, for under his caresses they became
        quite manageable again, though they still trembled. The driver again
        took his seat, and shaking his reins, started off at a great pace. This
        time, after going to the far side of the Pass, he suddenly turned down a
        narrow roadway which ran sharply to the right.</p>
        <p>Soon we were hemmed in with trees, which in places arched right over the
        roadway till we passed as through a tunnel; and again great frowning
        rocks guarded us boldly on either side. Though we were in shelter, we
        could hear the rising wind, for it moaned and whistled through the
        rocks, and the branches of the trees crashed together as we swept along.
        It grew colder and colder still, and fine, powdery snow began to fall,
        so that soon we and all around us were covered with a white blanket. The
        keen wind still carried the howling of the dogs, though this grew
        fainter as we went on our way. The baying of the wolves sounded nearer
        and nearer, as though they were closing round on us from every side. I
        grew dreadfully afraid, and the horses shared my fear. The driver,
        however, was not in the least disturbed; he kept turning his head to
        left and right, but I could not see anything through the darkness.</p>
        <p>Suddenly, away on our left, I saw a faint flickering blue flame. The
        driver saw it at the same moment; he at once checked the horses, and,
        jumping to the ground, disappeared into the darkness. I did not know
        what to do, the less as the howling of the wolves grew closer; but while
        I wondered the driver suddenly appeared again, and without a word took
        his seat, and we resumed our journey. I think I must have fallen asleep
        and kept dreaming of the incident, for it seemed to be repeated
        endlessly, and now looking back, it is like a sort of awful nightmare.
        Once the flame appeared so near the road, that even in the darkness
        around us I could watch the driver’s motions. He went rapidly to where
        the blue flame arose—it must have been very faint, for it did not seem
        to illumine the place around it at all—and gathering a few stones,
        formed them into some device. Once there appeared a strange optical
        effect: when he stood between me and the flame he did not obstruct it,
        for I could see its ghostly flicker all the same. This startled me, but
        as the effect was only momentary, I took it that my eyes deceived me
        straining through the darkness. Then for a time there were no blue
        flames, and we sped onwards through the gloom, with the howling of the
        wolves around us, as though they were following in a moving circle.</p>
        <p>At last there came a time when the driver went further afield than he
        had yet gone, and during his absence, the horses began to tremble worse
        than ever and to snort and scream with fright. I could not see any cause
        for it, for the howling of the wolves had ceased altogether; but just
        then the moon, sailing through the black clouds, appeared behind the
        jagged crest of a beetling, pine-clad rock, and by its light I saw
        around us a ring of wolves, with white teeth and lolling red tongues,
        with long, sinewy limbs and shaggy hair. They were a hundred times more
        terrible in the grim silence which held them than even when they howled.
        For myself, I felt a sort of paralysis of fear. It is only when a man
        feels himself face to face with such horrors that he can understand
        their true import.</p>
        <p>All at once the wolves began to howl as though the moonlight had had
        some peculiar effect on them. The horses jumped about and reared, and
        looked helplessly round with eyes that rolled in a way painful to see;
        but the living ring of terror encompassed them on every side; and they
        had perforce to remain within it. I called to the coachman to come, for
        it seemed to me that our only chance was to try to break out through the
        ring and to aid his approach. I shouted and beat the side of the
        calèche, hoping by the noise to scare the wolves from that side, so as
        to give him a chance of reaching the trap. How he came there, I know
        not, but I heard his voice raised in a tone of imperious command, and
        looking towards the sound, saw him stand in the roadway. As he swept his
        long arms, as though brushing aside some impalpable obstacle, the wolves
        fell back and back further still. Just then a heavy cloud passed across
        the face of the moon, so that we were again in darkness.</p>
        <p>When I could see again the driver was climbing into the calèche, and the
        wolves had disappeared. This was all so strange and uncanny that a
        dreadful fear came upon me, and I was afraid to speak or move. The time
        seemed interminable as we swept on our way, now in almost complete
        darkness, for the rolling clouds obscured the moon. We kept on
        ascending, with occasional periods of quick descent, but in the main
        always ascending. Suddenly, I became conscious of the fact that the
        driver was in the act of pulling up the horses in the courtyard of a
        vast ruined castle, from whose tall black windows came no ray of light,
        and whose broken battlements showed a jagged line against the moonlit
        sky.</p>

Of all the days of the year, upon that day:<br>
For I had then laid wormwood to my dug,<br>
Sitting in the sun under the dovehouse wall;<br>
My lord and you were then at Mantua:<br>
Nay, I do bear a brain. But as I said,<br>
When it did taste the wormwood on the nipple<br>
Of my dug and felt it bitter, pretty fool,<br>
To see it tetchy, and fall out with the dug!<br>
Shake, quoth the dovehouse: ’twas no need, I trow,<br>
To bid me trudge.<br>
And since that time it is eleven years;<br>
For then she could stand alone; nay, by th’rood<br>
She could have run and waddled all about;<br>
For even the day before she broke her brow,<br>
And then my husband,—God be with his soul!<br>
A was a merry man,—took up the child:<br>
‘Yea,’ quoth he, ‘dost thou fall upon thy face?<br>
Thou wilt fall backward when thou hast more wit;<br>
Wilt thou not, Jule?’ and, by my holidame,<br>
The pretty wretch left crying, and said ‘Ay’.<br>
To see now how a jest shall come about.<br>
I warrant, and I should live a thousand years,<br>
I never should forget it. ‘Wilt thou not, Jule?’ quoth he;<br>
And, pretty fool, it stinted, and said ‘Ay.’
